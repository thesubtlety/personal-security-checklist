  intro: >-
    Most reported data breaches are caused by the use of weak, default or stolen passwords
    (according to [this Verizon report](http://www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/reports/rp_dbir-2016-executive-summary_xg_en.pdf)).
    Use long, strong and unique passwords, manage them in a secure password manager, enable
    2-factor authentication, keep on top of breaches and take care while logging into your accounts.
  checklist:
  - point: Use a Strong Password
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      If your password is too short, or contains dictionary words, places or names- then it can be easily
      cracked through brute force, or guessed by someone. The easiest way to make a strong password, is by
      making it long (12+ characters)- consider using a 'passphrase', made up of many words. Alternatively,
      use a password generator to create a long, strong random password. Have a play with
      [HowSecureIsMyPassword.net](https://howsecureismypassword.net), to get an idea of how quickly common
      passwords can be cracked. Read more about creating strong passwords:
      [securityinabox.org](https://securityinabox.org/en/passwords/passwords-and-2fa/)

  - point: Don't reuse Passwords
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      If someone was to reuse a password, and one site they had an account with suffered a leak, then a
      criminal could easily gain unauthorized access to their other accounts. This is usually done through
      large-scale automated login requests, and it is called Credential Stuffing. Unfortunately this is all
      too common, but it's simple to protect against- use a different password for each of your online accounts

  - point: Use a Secure Password Manager
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      For most people it is going to be near-impossible to remember hundreds of strong and unique passwords.
      A password manager is an application that generates, stores and auto-fills your login credentials for you.
      All your passwords will be encrypted against 1 master passwords (which you must remember, and it should be
      very strong). Most password managers have browser extensions and mobile apps, so whatever device you are on,
      your passwords can be auto-filled. A good all-rounder is
      [Bitwarden](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/password-managers/bitwarden), or see
      [Recommended Password Managers](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/password-managers)

  - point: Avoid sharing passwords
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      While there may be times that you need to share access to an account with another person, you should
      generally avoid doing this because it makes it easier for the account to become compromised. If you
      absolutely do need to share a password for example when working on a team with a shared account this
      should be done via features built into a password manager.

  - point: Enable 2-Factor Authentication
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      2FA is where you must provide both something you know (a password) and something you have (such as a
      code on your phone) to log in. This means that if anyone has got your password (e.g. through phishing,
      malware or a data breach), they will not be able to log into your account. It's easy to get started,
      download [an authenticator app](https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy#2-factor-authentication)
      onto your phone, and then go to your account security settings and follow the steps to enable 2FA. Next
      time you log in on a new device, you will be prompted for the code that displays in the app on your phone
      (it works without internet, and the code usually changes every 30-seconds)

  - point: Keep Backup Codes Safe
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      When you enable multi-factor authentication, you will usually be given several codes that you can use if
      your 2FA method is lost, broken or unavailable. Keep these codes somewhere safe to prevent loss or
      unauthorized access. You should store these on paper or in a safe place on disk (e.g. in offline storage
      or in an encrypted file/drive). Don't store these in your Password Manager as 2FA sources and passwords
      and should be kept separately.

  - point: Sign up for Breach Alerts
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      After a website suffers a significant data breach, the leaked data often ends up on the internet. There
      are several websites that collect these leaked records, and allow you to search your email address to check
      if you are in any of their lists. [Firefox Monitor](https://monitor.firefox.com), [Have I been pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com)
      and [DeHashed](https://dehashed.com) allow you to sign up for monitoring, where they will notify you if your
      email address appears in any new data sets. It is useful to know as soon as possible when this happens, so
      that you can change your passwords for the affected accounts. [Have i been pwned](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/security-tools/online-tools/have-i-been-pwned) also has domain-wide
      notification, where you can receive alerts if any email addresses under your entire domain appear (useful if
      you use aliases for [anonymous forwarding](https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy#anonymous-mail-forwarding))

  - point: Shield your Password/ PIN
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      When typing your password in public places, ensure you are not in direct line of site of a CCTV camera and
      that no one is able to see over your shoulder. Cover your password or pin code while you type, and do not
      reveal any plain text passwords on screen

  - point: Update Critical Passwords Periodically
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Database leaks and breaches are common, and it is likely that several of your passwords are already somewhere
      online. Occasionally updating passwords of security-critical accounts can help mitigate this. But providing
      that all your passwords are long, strong and unique, there is no need to do this too often- annually should be
      sufficient. Enforcing mandatory password changes within organisations is [no longer recommended](https://duo.com/decipher/microsoft-will-no-longer-recommend-forcing-periodic-password-changes),
      as it encourages colleagues to select weaker passwords

  - point: Never answer online security questions truthfully
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      If a site asks security questions (such as place of birth, mother's maiden name or first car etc), don't provide
      real answers. It is a trivial task for hackers to find out this information online or through social engineering.
      Instead, create a fictitious answer, and store it inside your password manager. Using real-words is better than
      random characters, [explained here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29244870)

  - point: Don’t use a 4-digit PIN
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Don’t use a short PIN to access your smartphone or computer. Instead, use a text password or much longer pin.
      Numeric passphrases are easy crack, (A 4-digit pin has 10,000 combinations, compared to 7.4 million for a
      4-character alpha-numeric code)

  - point: Consider a Hardware Token
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      A U2F/ FIDO2 security key is a USB (or NFC) device that you insert while logging in to an online service, in to
      verify your identity, instead of entering a OTP from your authenticator. [SoloKey](https://solokeys.com) and
      [NitroKey](https://www.nitrokey.com) are examples of such keys. They bring with them several security benefits,
      since the browser communicates directly with the device and cannot be fooled as to which host is requesting
      authentication, because the TLS certificate is checked. [This post](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/71704) is
      a good explanation of the security of using FIDO U2F tokens. Of course it is important to store the physical key
      somewhere safe, or keep it on your person. Some online accounts allow for several methods of 2FA to be enabled

  - point: Consider Unique Usernames
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Having different passwords for each account is a good first step, but if you also use a unique username, email or
      phone number to log in, then it will be significantly harder for anyone trying to gain unauthorised access. The easiest
      method for multiple emails, is using auto-generated aliases for anonymous mail forwarding. This is where
      [anything]@yourdomain.com will arrive in your inbox, allowing you to use a different email for each account (see
      [Mail Alias Providers](https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy#anonymous-mail-forwarding)). Usernames are easier,
      since you can use your password manager to generate, store and auto-fill these. Virtual phone numbers can be generated
      through your VOIP provider

- title: Web Browsing
  slug: web-browsing
  description: Avoiding tracking, censorship, and data collection online
  icon: browser
  intro: >-
    Most websites on the internet will use some form of tracking, often to gain
    insight into their users behaviour and preferences. This data can be incredibly
    detailed, and so is extremely valuable to corporations, governments and intellectual
    property thieves. Data breaches and leaks are common, and deanonymizing users web
    activity is often a trivial task.


    There are two primary methods of tracking; stateful (cookie-based), and stateless
    (fingerprint-based). Cookies are small pieces of information, stored in your browser
    with a unique ID that is used to identify you. Browser fingerprinting is a highly
    accurate way to identify and track users wherever they go online. The information
    collected is quite comprehensive, and often includes browser details, OS, screen
    resolution, supported fonts, plugins, time zone, language and font preferences,
    and even hardware configurations.


    This section outlines the steps you can take, to be better protected from threats,
    minimise online tracking and improve privacy.
  checklist:
  - point: Block Ads
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Using an ad-blocker can help improve your privacy, by blocking the trackers that ads implement.
      [uBlock Origin](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/networking/ad-blockers/ublock-origin) is a very
      efficient and open source browser addon,
      developed by Raymond Hill. When 3rd-party ads are displayed on a webpage, they have the ability to
      track you, gathering personal information about you and your habits, which can then be sold, or used
      to show you more targeted ads, and some ads are plain malicious or fake. Blocking ads also makes pages
      load faster, uses less data and provides a less cluttered experience.

  - point: Ensure Website is Legitimate
    priority: Basic
    details: >-
      It may sound obvious, but when you logging into any online accounts, double check the URL is correct.
      Storing commonly visited sites in your bookmarks is a good way to ensure the URL is easy to find. When
      visiting new websites, look for common signs that it could be unsafe: Browser warnings, redirects,
      on-site spam and pop-ups. You can also check a website using a tool, such as:
      [Virus Total](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/security-tools/online-tools/virus-total),
      [IsLegitSite](https://www.islegitsite.com), [Google Safe Browsing Status](https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search)
      if you are unsure.

  - point: Watch out for Browser Malware
    priority: Basic
    details: >-
      Your system or browser can be compromised by spyware, miners, browser hijackers, malicious redirects,
      adware etc. You can usually stay protected, just by: ignoring pop-ups, be wary of what your clicking,
      don't proceed to a website if your browser warns you it may be malicious. Common signs of browser malware
      include: default search engine or homepage has been modified, toolbars, unfamiliar extensions or icons,
      significantly more ads, errors and pages loading much slower than usual. These articles from Heimdal
      explain [signs of browser malware](https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/warning-signs-operating-system-infected-malware),
      [how browsers get infected](https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/practical-online-protection-where-malware-hides)
      and [how to remove browser malware](https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/malware-removal).

  - point: Remove Unnecessary Browser Addons
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Extensions are able to see, log or modify anything you do in the browser, and some innocent looking
      browser apps, have malicious intentions. Websites can see which extensions you have installed, and may
      use this to enhance your fingerprint, to more accurately identify/ track you. Both [Firefox](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/browsers/firefox) and Chrome
      web stores allow you to check what permissions/access rights an extension requires before you install it.
      Check the reviews. Only install extensions you really need, and removed those which you haven't used in a while.

  - point: Keep Browser Up-to-date
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Browser vulnerabilities are constantly being [discovered](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=browser)
      and patched, so it’s important to keep it up to date, to avoid a zero-day exploit. You can [see which browser
      version you're using here](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/), or follow [this guide](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/guides/how-to-update-your-browser/)
      for instructions on how to update. Some browsers will auto-update to the latest stable version.

  - point: Check for HTTPS
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      If you enter information on a non-HTTPS website, this data is transported unencrypted and can therefore
      be read by anyone who intercepts it. Do not enter any data on a non-HTTPS website, but also do not let
      the green padlock give you a false sense of security, just because a website has SSL certificate, does
      not mean that it is legitimate or trustworthy. [HTTPS-Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere)
      (developed by the [EFF](https://www.eff.org/)) used to be a browser extension/addon that automatically
      enabled HTTPS on websites, but as of 2022 is now deprecated. In their [accouncement article](https://www.eff.org/)
      the EFF explains that most browsers now integrate such protections. Additionally, it provides instructions
      for [Firefox](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/browsers/firefox), Chrome, Edge and Safari browsers on how to enable their HTTPS secure protections.

  - point: Use Incognito
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      When using someone else's machine, ensure that you're in a private/ incognito session. This will
      prevent browser history, cookies and some data being saved, but is not fool-proof- you can still
      be tracked.

  description: Protecting the gateway to your online accounts
  icon: email
  intro: >-
    Nearly 50 years since the first email was sent, it's still very much a big part
    of our day-to-day life, and will continue to be for the near future. So considering
    how much trust we put in them, it's surprising how fundamentally insecure this
    infrastructure is. Email-related fraud
    [is on the up](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3247670/email/email-security-in-2018.html),
    and without taking basic measures you could be at risk.
    

    If a hacker gets access to your emails, it provides a gateway for your other
    accounts to be compromised (through password resets), therefore email security
    is paramount for your digital safety.


    The big companies providing "free" email service, don't have a good reputation
    for respecting users privacy: Gmail was caught giving
    [third parties full access](https://www.wsj.com/articles/techs-dirty-secret-the-app-developers-sifting-through-your-gmail-1530544442)
    to user emails and also [tracking all of your purchases](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/17/google-gmail-tracks-purchase-history-how-to-delete-it.html).
    Yahoo was also caught scanning emails in real-time [for US surveillance agencies](http://news.trust.org/item/20161004170601-99f8c)
    Advertisers [were granted access](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2018/08/29/both-yahoo-and-aol-are-scanning-customer-emails-to-attract-advertisers)
    to Yahoo and AOL users messages to “identify and segment potential customers by picking up on contextual buying signals, and past purchases.”

  checklist:
  - point: Have more than one email address
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Consider using a different email address for security-critical communications from trivial mail such
      as newsletters. This compartmentalization could reduce the amount of damage caused by a data breach,
      and also make it easier to recover a compromised account.

  - point: Keep your Account Secure
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Use a long and unique password, enable 2FA and be careful while logging in. Your email account
      provides an easy entry point to all your other online accounts for an attacker.

  - point: Don’t connect third-party apps to your email account
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      If you give a third-party app or plug-in full access to your inbox, they effectively have full unhindered
      access to all your emails and their contents, which poses significant security and privacy risks.

  - point: Don't Share Sensitive Data via Email
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Emails are very easily intercepted. Furthermore, you can’t be sure of how secure your recipient's
      environment is. Therefore, emails cannot be considered safe for exchanging confidential information,
      unless it is encrypted.

  - point: Subaddressing
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      An alternative to aliasing is subaddressing, where anything after the `+` symbol is omitted during mail delivery.
      This enables you to keep track of who shared/ leaked your email address, but unlike aliasing, it will not protect
      against your real address being revealed.

  icon: social
  intro: >
    Online communities have existed since the invention of the internet, and give
    people around the world the opportunity to connect, communicate and share.
    Although these networks are a great way to promote social interaction and
    bring people together, that have a dark side - there are some serious
    [Privacy Concerns with Social Networking Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_with_social_networking_services),
    and these social networking sites are owned by private corporations,
    and that they make their money by collecting data about individuals and
    selling that data on, often to third party advertisers.

    Secure your account, lock down your privacy settings, but know that even
    after doing so, all data intentionally and non-intentionally uploaded is
    effectively public. If possible, avoid using conventional social media networks.
  checklist:
  - point: Secure your Account
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Social media profiles get stolen or taken over all too often. To protect your account: use a unique
      and strong password, and enable 2-factor authentication.

  - point: Check Privacy Settings
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Most social networks allow you to control your privacy settings. Ensure that you are comfortable with
      what data you are currently exposing and to whom.

  - point: Think of All Interactions as Public
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      There are still numerous methods of viewing a users 'private' content across many social networks.
      Therefore, before uploading, posting or commenting on anything, think "Would I mind if this was totally public?"

  - point: Think of All Interactions as Permanent
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Pretty much every post, comment, photo etc is being continuously backed up by a myriad of third-party
      services, who archive this data and make it indexable and publicly available almost forever.

  - point: Don't Reveal too Much
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Profile information creates a goldmine of info for hackers, the kind of data that helps them personalize
      phishing scams. Avoid sharing too much detail (DoB, Hometown, School etc).

  - point: Be Careful what you Upload
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Status updates, comments, check-ins and media can unintentionally reveal a lot more than you intended
      them to. This is especially relevant to photos and videos, which may show things in the background.

  - point: Don't Share Email or Phone Number
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Posting your real email address or mobile number, gives hackers, trolls and spammers more munition to
      use against you, and can also allow separate aliases, profiles or data points to be connected.

  - point: Don't Grant Unnecessary Permissions
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      By default many of the popular social networking apps will ask for permission to access your contacts,
      call log, location, messaging history etc. If they don’t need this access, don’t grant it.

  - point: Be Careful of 3rd-Party Integrations
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Avoid signing up for accounts using a Social Network login, revoke access to social apps you no longer
      use.

  - point: Avoid Publishing Geo Data while still Onsite
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      If you plan to share any content that reveals a location, then wait until you have left that place.
      This is particularly important when you are taking a trip, at a restaurant, campus, hotel/resort, public
      building or airport.

  - point: Remove metadata before uploading media
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Most smartphones and some cameras automatically attach a comprehensive set of additional data (called
      EXIF data) to each photograph. Remove this data before uploading.

  - point: Don’t have any social media accounts
    priority: Advanced
    details: >-
      Social media is fundamentally un-private, so for maximum online security and privacy, avoid using any
      mainstream social networks.

    This section covers how you connect your devices to the internet securely,
    including configuring your router and setting up a VPN.
  checklist:
  - point: Change your Router Password
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      After getting a new router, change the password. Default router passwords are publicly available,
      meaning anyone within proximity would be able to connect.

  - point: Use WPA3, and a strong password
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      There are different authentication protocols for connecting to WiFi. Currently, the most secure options
      are WPA2 and WPA3 (on newer routers).

  - point: Keep router firmware up-to-date
    priority: Essential
    details: >-
      Manufacturers release firmware updates that fix security vulnerabilities, implement new standards, and
      sometimes add features or improve the performance of your router.

  - point: Secure DNS
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Use DNS-over-HTTPS which performs DNS resolution via the HTTPS protocol, encrypting data between you
      and your DNS resolver.

  - point: Use a Guest Network for Guests
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      Do not grant access to your primary WiFi network to visitors, as it enables them to interact with other
      devices on the network.

  - point: Disable Unused Remote Access Protocols
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      When protocols such as PING, Telnet, SSH, UPnP, and HNAP etc are enabled, they allow your router to be
      probed from anywhere in the world.

  - point: Manage Range Correctly
    priority: Optional
    details: >-
      It's common to want to pump your router's range to the max, but if you reside in a smaller flat, your
      attack surface is increased when your WiFi network can be picked up across the street.

  intro: >
    Smart phones have revolutionized so many aspects of life and brought the world
    to our fingertips. For many of us, smart phones are our primary means of communication,
    entertainment and access to knowledge. But while they've brought convenience
    to whole new level, there's some ugly things going on behind the screen.

    Geo-tracking is used to trace our every move, and we have little control over
    who has this data- your phone is even able to
    [track your location without GPS](https://gizmodo.com/how-to-track-a-cellphone-without-gps-or-consent-1821125371).
    Over the years numerous reports that surfaced, outlining ways in which your
    phone's [mic can eavesdrop](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/smartphone-apps-listening-privacy-alphonso-shazam-advertising-pool-3d-honey-quest-a8139451.html),
    and the [camera can watch you](https://www.businessinsider.com/hackers-governments-smartphone-iphone-camera-wikileaks-cybersecurity-hack-privacy-webcam-2017-6)- all without your knowledge or consent.
    And then there's the malicious apps, lack of security patches and potential/ likely backdoors.

    Using a smart phone generates a lot of data about you- from information you
    intentionally share, to data silently generated from your actions.
    It can be scary to see what Google, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook know about
    us- sometimes they know more than our closest family. It's hard to comprehend
    what your data will reveal, especially in conjunction with other data.

    This data is used for
    [far more than just advertising](https://internethealthreport.org/2018/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-sides-of-data-tracking/) -
    more often it's used to rate people for finance, insurance and employment.
    Targeted ads can even be used for fine-grained surveillance (see [ADINT](https://adint.cs.washington.edu))

    More of us are concerned about how
    [governments use collect and use our smart phone data](https://www.statista.com/statistics/373916/global-opinion-online-monitoring-government/),
    and rightly so, federal agencies often
    [request our data from Google](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273501/global-data-requests-from-google-by-federal-agencies-and-governments/),
    [Facebook](https://www.statista.com/statistics/287845/global-data-requests-from-facebook-by-federal-agencies-and-governments/),
    Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and other tech companies. Sometimes requests are
    made in bulk, returning detailed information on everybody within a certain geo-fence,
    [often for innocent people](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/13/us/google-location-tracking-police.html).
    And this doesn't include all of the internet traffic that intelligence agencies around the world have unhindered access to.

    Public records often include sensitive personal data (full name, date of birth,
    phone number, email, address, ethnicity etc), and are gathered from a range of
    sources (census records, birth/ death/ marriage certificates, voter registrants,
    marketing information, customer databases, motor vehicle records, professional/
    business licenses and all court files in full detail). This sensitive personal
    information is
    [easy and legal to access](https://www.consumerreports.org/consumerist/its-creepy-but-not-illegal-for-this-website-to-provide-all-your-public-info-to-anyone/),
    which raises some [serious privacy concerns](https://privacyrights.org/resources/public-records-internet-privacy-dilemma)
